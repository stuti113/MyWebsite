        <p class="explain"> TThis game is a retirement savings calculate. You can calculate how much you need to put into your savings account monthly to be able to quit working forever after a certain age. Note: While plugging in the interest rate don't use percent sign (for example
      type 7 and not 7%). Similiarly while inputing money you plan to have don't use dollar sign or commas( for example if you want to save $100,000, just type 100000).</p>
