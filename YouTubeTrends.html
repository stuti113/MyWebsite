      <p id="newFont">I have been teaching myself data science and machine learning lately using MOOCs on coursera and Udemy. And I am perpetually watching YouTube videos! So I decided to acquire data about YouTube videos and run my newly learned DS and ML agorithms to derive insights from that data. My goal is to analyze and sort channels based on their views, trending videos, likes, and dislikes. I also wish to research factors that effect the popularity of a YouTube Video. I retrieved this data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a>. Kaggle is a really good resource to get authentic data sets to play around and practice with. I did some data preparation and cleaning prior to mking insights to get rid of lengthy description column, skewed rows, and insufficient or incompete rows.</p>

      <h2 id="headingFont">Data Preparation and Cleaning</h2>
      <!-- <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by John Doe, Sep 24, 2015.</h5>
      <h5><span class="label label-success">Lorem</span></h5><br> -->
      <p id="newFont"> Before I could connect the data to tableau or upload the csv files into MATLAB or Pandas I decided to clean the data. I noticed there were a lot of un even or empty rows. I also noticed how the description was way too long and didn't contain information that I could use for the kind of insights I wante to draw. I decided to delete the description column and upload the the data in SSIS to practice and perform <b>extraction, transformation, and load(ETL)</b>
        Following is a screenshot describing the process. <br> <img src='5.Insights/SSIS.JPG'> </br> I used the first conditional split to get rid of the extra
      rows that don't have sufficient information in the columns that I would need for getting my desired insights. I did this by using a boolean condition checking for empty columns. This got rid of <b>3323</b> rows. All of these were just leftover truncated data from that messy description column I manually removed. I then checked for skewed data to see what caused empty columns 15-26 by changing non empty columns. This got rid of <b>6 identical rows</b>. The leftover data was send to an OLE DB destination hence producing a Raw Data Table of records in SQL
      <br></br>
    <p> The data cleaning and preparation didn't end here. My Udemy instructor Kirill Eremenko mentioned how ETL process often becomes TETL
        or TETLT instead of just ETL because we continue to prep and transfer data to get the most robust model. Before turning RAW Table into a WORK Table I check if empty Columns 15 through 26
        were indeed empty and conditional split was indeed successful in removing all the skewed unecessary description. Turns out columns 15-26 are empty in the filtered out data so they were safe to discard without losing any rows. So now I proceeded towards making a WRK table using Procedures in SQL as follows:
        <br> <img src="5.Insights/storedproc1.JPG"></br>
    A <b>stored procedure</b> lets us create a WORK table using the RAW table. Upon executing this command I got the following error.
    <br><img src="5.Insights/RAWWRKError.JPG"></br>
    Stored procedure was fully relying on <b>implicit conversion</b> by SQL but this error shows that there might just be some more anomalies in our data that we need to get rid of. Since it wasn't able to convert string to date 
    this tells me that there is a possibility that there is a record that still has some text instead of publish or trending date. Here is how I checked further.
    <br><img src="5.Insights/notDate.JPG"><br>
    This command returned all the records that have texts in the dates columns> next thing, I deleted all of these records because trending date and publish date are crucial to my research and any records that don't have that information won't be of any use to me. 
    <br><img src="5.Insights/removing_it.JPG"></br>
    This command removed all those records and I now had <b>19772</b>. Before excluding these rows the data <b>19793</b> rows. So 21 records were removed.
    <br> </br>
    I did some additional checks to thoroughly check my data. They didn't return any anamolous rows but it's always good to do extra checks.
    <br> <img src="5.Insights/views-likes.JPG"> </br> 
    Some times number of views is less than total likes and everyone is leaving comments like- "YouTube you'se drunk" or "YouTube be Trippin'" and I wanted to check for that lol.
    <br> <img src="5.Insights/date.JPG"></br>
    I checked to make sure there is no data where the publish date is after trending date because that would have been an error or anomaly I wouldn't want to include in my study. 
    Fortunately all of my additional checks failed and didn't return any rows. At this point I felt my data was clean and I could proceed towards drawing insights from my data.

        <li> Trending and Uploading Days
    <p id="newFont">We were then split into teams and assigned a tour guide to take us around. Our tour guide was a wonderful pinployee who opened her introduction by asking us to guess the countries Pinterest is expanding in. It was interesting to learn that despite being a relatively young company
    Pinterest is reaching so far! We then walked around and saw more beautiful things. My two favorite things were the knitting station and the wine themed office. A lot of my students were so happy to learn that the office is dog friendly. We then proceeded towards the panel discussion led by about 6 female pinployees. They talked about their experience and future aspirations. This is where my pincrush(sorry for all the pinterest puns!) went beyond what some might call a superficial interest. Apart from being extremely aesthetically pleasing, pinterest is also full of skilled software engineers, mathematicians, and creators. At girls who code graduation our keynote speaker gave a speech and talked about how companies in future would prefer STEAM majors over just STEM majors, that extra A being art. And I think companies like pinterest are already showing this trait that is anticipated to be desirable in future. Our tour guide pointed out how all the posters and pictures on the walls were for a campaign and all the photographers and models were actual pinterest employees. I was extremely inspired by the varied backgrounds and life stories of the panelists and for once, I didn't see as much gender disparity as I usually see when I tour a tech company office. They also value creativity and art. Our tour guide told us how employees often come to the knitting nook and create their own things or do pinterest crafts.</p>
