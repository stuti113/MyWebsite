      <p id="newFont">I have been teaching myself data science and machine learning lately using MOOCs on coursera and Udemy. And I am perpetually watching YouTube videos! So I decided to acquire data about YouTube videos and run my newly learned DS and ML agorithms to derive insights from that data. My goal is to analyze and sort channels based on their views, trending videos, likes, and dislikes. I also wish to research factors that effect the popularity of a YouTube Video. I retrieved this data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a>. Kaggle is a really good resource to get authentic data sets to play around and practice with. I did some data preparation and cleaning prior to mking insights to get rid of lengthy description column, skewed rows, and insufficient or incompete rows.</p>

      <h2 id="headingFont">Data Preparation and Cleaning</h2>
      <!-- <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by John Doe, Sep 24, 2015.</h5>
      <h5><span class="label label-success">Lorem</span></h5><br> -->
      <p id="newFont"> Before I could connect the data to tableau or upload the csv files into MATLAB or Pandas I decided to clean the data. I noticed there were a lot of un even or empty rows. I also noticed how the description was way too long and didn't contain information that I could use for the kind of insights I wante to draw. I decided to delete the description column and upload the the data in SSIS to practice and perform <b>extraction, transformation, and load(ETL)</b>
        Following is a screenshot describing the process. <br> <img src='SSIS.jpg'> </br> I used the first conditional split to get rid of the extra
      rows that don't have sufficient information in the columns that I would need for getting my desired insights. I did this by using a boolean condition checking for empty columns. This got rid of 3323 rows. All of these were just leftover truncated data from that messy description column I manually removed. I then checked for skewed data to see what caused empty columns 15-26 by changing non empty columns. This got rid of 6 identical rows. The leftover data was send to an OLE DB destination hence producing a Raw Data Table of records in SQL</p>

    <h2 id="headingFont">Tour of the office space and Panel</h2>

    <p id="newFont">We were then split into teams and assigned a tour guide to take us around. Our tour guide was a wonderful pinployee who opened her introduction by asking us to guess the countries Pinterest is expanding in. It was interesting to learn that despite being a relatively young company
    Pinterest is reaching so far! We then walked around and saw more beautiful things. My two favorite things were the knitting station and the wine themed office. A lot of my students were so happy to learn that the office is dog friendly. We then proceeded towards the panel discussion led by about 6 female pinployees. They talked about their experience and future aspirations. This is where my pincrush(sorry for all the pinterest puns!) went beyond what some might call a superficial interest. Apart from being extremely aesthetically pleasing, pinterest is also full of skilled software engineers, mathematicians, and creators. At girls who code graduation our keynote speaker gave a speech and talked about how companies in future would prefer STEAM majors over just STEM majors, that extra A being art. And I think companies like pinterest are already showing this trait that is anticipated to be desirable in future. Our tour guide pointed out how all the posters and pictures on the walls were for a campaign and all the photographers and models were actual pinterest employees. I was extremely inspired by the varied backgrounds and life stories of the panelists and for once, I didn't see as much gender disparity as I usually see when I tour a tech company office. They also value creativity and art. Our tour guide told us how employees often come to the knitting nook and create their own things or do pinterest crafts.</p>

  <p id="newFont">The fieldtrip ended right after the panel and we said our final goodbye. I wished the panel lasted longer or extended into a meet and greet with the panelists. I would have loved to personally talk to those women and thank them for sharing their stories with us. But we had to head back to resume our final projects planning and other classroom stuff. It was most definitely the more memorable and inspiring fieldtrip I have ever been to.
